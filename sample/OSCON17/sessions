In 1992, Miller (working with his then-student Jeffrey Hollingsworth), founded the field of dynamic binary code instrumentation and coined the term \u201cdynamic instrumentation,\u201d which forms the basis for his current efforts in malware analysis and instrumentation. His research interests include systems security, binary and malicious code analysis and instrumentation of extreme-scale systems, parallel and distributed program measurement and debugging, and mobile computing.

Kelsey is a strong open source advocate focused on building simple tools that make people smile. When he is not slinging Go code, you can catch him giving technical workshops covering everything from programming and system administration, to his favorite Linux distro of the month.",
